Your homework today is to recreate the Surf and Paddle mockup (surf-paddle.png).

All of the assets you should need are located in the /assets folder.

This needs to be as pixel perfect as you can make it. To help with this you can use the Chrome Plugin, PerfectPixel. I will be overlaying the mockup to check your homework.

You should also use Normalize CSS

Also, you will need to utilize Google Fonts

This homework is due Monday morning by 8am and should be uploaded to your Github account titled "Surf_Paddle" and you should send me an e-mail with the link to your repository.
